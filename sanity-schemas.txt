    **Focus on designing schemas in Sanity to align with the business goals**

Why sanity?

Modern Headless CMS:

Sanity is a headless CMS (Content Management System), which means it separates content management from presentation. It allows you to manage content without being tied to a specific frontend technology.
Unlike traditional CMS platforms, Sanity doesn’t dictate how your content is displayed. You have the flexibility to use any front end framework or technology stack.

Structured Content and Reusability:

Sanity uses structured content, allowing you to define schemas for your data. This structured approach ensures consistency and enables content reuse across different channels (web, mobile, etc.).
You can create reusable content blocks (like components) and assemble them dynamically.

Composable Approach:

Sanity follows a composable approach. You can connect it to any third-party technology or data source.
Whether you need to integrate with APIs, databases, or other services, Sanity provides the flexibility to compose your tech stack as needed.

Real-Time Datastore:

Sanity’s real-time datastore lets you store and query JSON documents. You can subscribe to real-time changes, making it suitable for dynamic applications.

Schemas: Schemas are the heart of our content structure. They describe the attributes (fields) of our content and how to interact with it in the studio.

Document Types: A document type is a collection of schema types used to build a standalone piece of content. Each document type typically consists of multiple fields.They define schema type in plain JS on TS objects.

CREATING SCHEMA WITH EXAMPLE:creating a simple schema for a “Person” content type. We’ll add fields for the person’s full name etc.

create  a file like person.tsx

define a schema here;
name:"person",
title:"person",
type:"document",
fields:[{name: "fullName", title:"fullName", type:"string"},]

In this schema:
name and title define the schema type.
fields specify the attributes for the person document.

2-Import the Schema:
In the main schema file and add it to the schemaTypes array.

3- The sanity studio loads all the schemas defined in the schemas type.The studio also allows to create a new person document.

ALLIGNNG  IT WITH  BUSINESS  GOAL:

MedSwift aims to provide a seamless experience for patients seeking medical services.
Patients should be able to register, manage their profiles, and access relevant health information.

SCHEMA DESIGN:
Patient document type:

name:"patient',
title:"patient',
id:"id',
type:"document',

fields:[{name:"fullName", title:'fullName', type:"string"},
{
name:"email", title:"email",type:"string", volidation:(rule) => rule.email()
}
{
name:"gender",type:"string", options: {
list:['male','female']}
}
{name:"medicalHistory", title:'medicalHistory', type:"text"},
{name:"address", title:'address', type:"string"},
{name:"phone no.", title:phone no. , type:number},
]

Business Impact:

By capturing essential patient data, MedSwift can:

Personalize recommendations based on medical history.
Send appointment reminders via email.
It also managing doctors profile,prescription etc.
